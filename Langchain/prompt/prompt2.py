        6. Convert **price and discount** into strings, following these rules:
           - If the query mentions **"less than"**, **"below"**, **"under"**, **"cheaper than"**, return `"<price_value"` (lt).
           - If the query mentions **"greater than"**, **"above"**, **"more than"**, return `">price_value"` (gt).
